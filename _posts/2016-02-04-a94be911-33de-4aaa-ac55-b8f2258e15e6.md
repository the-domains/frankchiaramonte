I think, I think a lot sometimes. Sometimes I create, sometimes beautiful things,  I am good at solving things, sometimes its appreciated, sometimes its not. Whatever it is I do for my clients, whether its installing draperies or creating a new interior design projects, or just handy work and organizing your space. I always try my best. I hope you enjoy what I have to show you and always realize that I will be professional towards you.

When I coach children in the game of Hockey, I try to teach them the lesson of the game beyond the game. I teach fun, I teach competitveness, I teach them about respect for your teammates and your opponents. When it comes to family I try to be the best I can, and when it comes to friends I try to be as loyal as I can be. I'm not perfect. I am, Frank Chiaramonte.
